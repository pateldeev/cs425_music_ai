# ML Model Code
Code for training and running the music generation code. There are three main entry points. Each file contains further documentation and examples:
* [main_midi_only](https://github.com/pateldeev/cs425_music_ai/blob/main/ml_model/main_midi_only.py): Training script that only supports midi files with piano music. Our very first training script.
* [main](https://github.com/pateldeev/cs425_music_ai/blob/main/ml_model/main.py): Training script that supports supports multiple instruments using [spleeter](https://splitter.ai/) and their pretrained [5 stems models](https://github.com/deezer/spleeter/wiki/2.-Getting-started#using-5stems-model).
* [main2](https://github.com/pateldeev/cs425_music_ai/blob/main/ml_model/main2.py): New and improved experimental version still under development.
